A small tool for grabbing PubMed papers.

After cleaning the text a bit, it's ready for use in calculating a variety of stats about the paper.
Create a file called `pmcids.txt` containing the PMC IDs of interest. 

It's important to abide by the terms of access. More info at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/oai/.
